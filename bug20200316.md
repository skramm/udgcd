## bug20200316.md

This page describes this bug as of today.

The target `make runsam` runs all the samples **correctly**:
for all the samples graphs in `samples/`, the app `read_graph.cpp` finds the correct number of cycles, and they are all correct.

However:
I noticed that for some random graphs (generated with `random_test.cpp`), I got wrong results.
I saved one of these into the folder `samples2/`.

To trigger the bug:<br>
`bin/read_graph samples2/graph_1583824532.txt>stdout`

### What happens:

The binary matrix goes through a Gaussian Reduction step:
see function `gaussianElim()`
And during this process, the lines are modified (XOR).
It appears that this can generate a binary vector representing a cycle where a node is connected to more than 2 other nodes.
This can't be.


If the line representing a invalid vector is copied into the output matrix, then we have a failure.

### Solution found:
No solution at present.
