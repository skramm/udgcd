## bug20200316.md

This page describes this bug as of today.

The target `make runsam` runs all the samples **correctly**:
for all the samples graphs in `samples/`, the app `read_graph.cpp` finds the correct number of cycles, and they are all correct.

However:
I noticed that for some random graphs (generated with `random_test.cpp`), I got wrong results.
I saved one of these into the folder `samples2/`.

To trigger the bug:<br>
`bin/read_graph samples2/graph_1583824532.txt>stdout`
<br>or:<br>
`make bug`

### What happens:

The binary matrix goes through a Gaussian Reduction step:
see function `gaussianElim()`
And during this process, the lines are modified (XOR).
It appears that this can generate a binary vector representing a cycle where a node is connected to more than 2 other nodes.
This can't be.


If the line representing a invalid vector is copied into the output matrix, then we have a failure.

### Current work:
 - 20200319: with the above input, using the current code, we see that the problem
 appears with line 13 of the reduced binary matrix (holds 20 lines=>20 cycles)
 (See generated plot).

While the number of cycles is correct, the cycles are not minimal:
The code produces this cycle: `4-14-12-23`
that can /should be be reduced to `12-14-23` and `4-14-23`

This also means that there is another incorrect cycle, as the total number of cycles is 20.

Current output pairs and corresponding cycles (#13 is incorrect and has been artificialy stopped).

4 cycles are NOT chordless...
